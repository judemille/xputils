### Closed-Source Use

Do you want to use this software in a closed-source project? No problem![^1] Reach out
to me [via email.](mailto:prosperity@jdemille.com). I'll be happy to work out a fair
agreement between you/your organization and myself.

My goal is to make it perfectly palatable for commercial entities to use the utilities I
have created, whilst ensuring that my work does not go uncompensated or unacknowledged. I
have no interest in milking you for profits, or giving you trouble.

[^1]: I am not amicable to projects that are closed-source for no good reason. Whether
      being a commercial product is a good reason for being closed-source is a separate
      question, but if your project is freeware, but closed-source -- why not just
      open-source it? What are you afraid of?
